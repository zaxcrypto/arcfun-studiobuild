                <TSection title="2. Description of ArcFun & Non-Custodial Role">
                  <p>ArcFun provides a decentralized, non-custodial web software interface that enables users to interact with autonomous public smart contracts on supported blockchain networks. The core functionalities include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>ArcFun Wallet:</strong> An embedded multi-chain digital wallet interface powered by Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets (Programmable Wallets), allowing users to generate and manage addresses across supported networks (e.g. Arc, Solana, Ethereum) through Circle&apos;s cryptographic infrastructure.</li>
                    <li><strong>ArcFun Bridge &amp; Gateway:</strong> Facilitates cross-chain native USDC transfers utilizing Circle&apos;s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) and Circle Gateway.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web3 Chat &amp; Social Pay:</strong> Decentralized wallet-to-wallet messaging interface supporting direct peer-to-peer USDC transfers, recurring autopay schedules, and social payment requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bridge Recovery Utility (/recover):</strong> Provides an interface allowing users to manually self-claim or resume pending cross-chain CCTP transfers using on-chain transaction data and Circle Iris attestations.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>ArcFun is not a bank, broker, dealer, exchange, custodian, investment adviser, money transmitter, or financial institution. ArcFun never holds custody of, possesses, or controls user digital assets.</p>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="3. Eligibility">
                  <p>You represent and warrant that:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You are at least 18 years of age or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction.</li>
                    <li>You have full legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</li>
                    <li>You are not located in, resident of, or organized under the laws of any jurisdiction subject to comprehensive economic sanctions (including sanctions enforced by OFAC, the UN, EU, or UK).</li>
                    <li>You are not a person identified on any prohibited or restricted-party list.</li>
                    <li>Your use of ArcFun complies with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to you.</li>
                  </ul>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="4. ArcFun Wallet Architecture & Circle Technology Disclosure">
                  <p>ArcFun Wallet is powered by Circle Internet Financial, LLC (&quot;Circle&quot;) utilizing Circle&apos;s Programmable Wallets / Developer-Controlled Wallets (DCW) infrastructure and SDKs. You explicitly understand and agree that:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>No ArcFun Custody or Fund Access:</strong> ArcFun does NOT possess, hold, or store user private keys, seed phrases, or wallet funds. ArcFun operators, developers, and servers have zero custody and no direct access to withdraw, transfer, freeze, or confiscate your cryptocurrency balances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Cryptographic Key Infrastructure:</strong> Wallet address creation, cryptographic key management, hardware security module (HSM) signing, multi-party computation (MPC) sharding, and blockchain broadcasting are executed exclusively through Circle&apos;s independent API infrastructure and public blockchain nodes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mandatory Agreement for Funding:</strong> You must ONLY fund, deposit into, or bridge assets to an ArcFun Wallet if you fully understand and accept that ArcFun is not a custodian, does not guarantee wallet availability, and has no capacity to recover lost credentials or reverse on-chain transactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Service Security Controls:</strong> Users configure security preferences (e.g. Passkeys, secondary authorization passwords, transaction limits) via our interface, which are transmitted to cryptographic verification endpoints. You are solely responsible for securing your personal device, browser session, and recovery credentials.</li>
                  </ul>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="5. Third-Party Infrastructure, Security Incidents & Partner Disclaimer">
                  <p>ArcFun relies upon independent third-party technology providers, including Circle Internet Financial, LLC (for wallet infrastructure, CCTP, and Iris attestations), cloud hosting platforms, edge proxies (Cloudflare), and decentralized blockchain networks.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Control Over Third Parties:</strong> ArcFun does not own, operate, control, or supervise the internal servers, cryptographic enclaves, or operational security protocols of Circle or any other third-party provider.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Exploits &amp; Technical Failures:</strong> In the event of any security breach, zero-day vulnerability, unauthorized access, server compromise, protocol exploit, network partition, technical disruption, insolvency, service cessation, or regulatory action affecting Circle, underlying blockchain networks, or third-party infrastructure partners, ArcFun bears zero responsibility or liability.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Obligation to Reimburse:</strong> ArcFun is under no legal, financial, or equitable obligation to reimburse, refund, replace, or indemnify any user for losses, locked assets, delayed bridge completions, or diminished balances resulting from third-party infrastructure failures, network reorganizations, or external protocol exploits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Circle Disclaimer:</strong> Circle is an independent third party and does not endorse, guarantee, or insure ArcFun or user balances held in ArcFun Wallets.</li>
                  </ul>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="6. ArcFun Bridge & Circle CCTP Integration">
                  <p>When you use the ArcFun Bridge or Gateway:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You initiate and sign a source-chain transaction that deposits or burns native USDC through Circle CCTP or Gateway smart contracts.</li>
                    <li>Circle Iris attestation services generate cryptographic proofs of burn once source-chain finality is achieved.</li>
                    <li>Destination-chain completion may be submitted by ArcFun&apos;s relayer (where ArcFun only supplies destination gas fees) or executed directly by you via the /recover self-claim flow.</li>
                    <li>Relayer gas credentials held by ArcFun are strictly operational gas-paying keys and do NOT have access to or control over user wallets.</li>
                  </ul>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="7. Web3 Chat & Social Payments">
                  <p>ArcFun Web3 Chat enables direct wallet-to-wallet communication and integrated cryptocurrency transfers:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Transfers:</strong> In-chat payments transfer funds directly between autonomous smart contracts and user-controlled addresses. ArcFun does not intermediate or hold user funds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Autopay &amp; Recurring Payments:</strong> Users may schedule automated transfers subject to pre-configured spending limits and account balances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recipient Verification:</strong> You are solely responsible for verifying the identity and public address of any party with whom you exchange messages or initiate transfers.</li>
                  </ul>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="8. Circle Gateway & Unified Liquidity">
                  <p>Where supported, ArcFun facilitates unified liquidity settlement across multiple chains powered by Circle Gateway. Users understand that settlement speed and cross-chain messaging rely upon autonomous smart contracts and Circle infrastructure.</p>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="10. Fees">
                  <p>Transactions on public blockchains require network gas fees paid to third-party validators. Where ArcFun charges a protocol fee on trades or deployments, such fees are clearly displayed in the interface and executed directly on-chain by the smart contracts. ArcFun does not promise or provide unverified future yield or revenue share mechanics.</p>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="11. Transactions and Blockchain Finality">
                  <p>Due to the immutable nature of blockchain networks, transactions cannot be cancelled, modified, or reversed once confirmed on-chain. ArcFun does not maintain a custodial refund pool. A reverted cross-chain or chat transfer does not create an ArcFun-held user balance. While the /recover tool allows claiming eligible pending bridge transfers when protocol state permits, recovery is not a guarantee of compensation for losses caused by external network failures.</p>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="12. Prohibited Activities">
                  <p>You agree not to use ArcFun for: illegal token issuance, fraud, rug pulls, scams, phishing, deploying malware or malicious contracts, sanctions evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing, market manipulation (such as wash trading or spoofing), abusive automated exploitation, or attempting to compromise platform infrastructure.</p>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="13. No Investment Advice">
                  <p>ArcFun does not provide financial, investment, legal, accounting, or tax advice. Market metrics, charts, prices, and token rankings shown on the interface are for informational purposes only. You are solely responsible for conducting your own research and evaluating the risks of any transaction.</p>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="14. No Guarantee of Availability">
                  <p>ArcFun is provided on an &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free, or continuous access to the interface. Access may be suspended or modified at any time due to maintenance, network congestion, or security updates.</p>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="15. No Guarantee of Profit">
                  <p>Digital assets, meme tokens, and cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile. There is no guarantee of profit, stability, liquidity, or value preservation. You may lose the entire amount of capital used in transactions.</p>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="16. Smart Contract & Network Risks">
                  <p>You acknowledge the inherent risks of interacting with smart contracts, decentralized applications, and blockchain networks, including potential software bugs, unexpected contract execution, blockchain forks, validator downtime, and RPC node latency.</p>
                </TSection>

                <TSection title="17. Limitation of Liability">
                  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall ArcFun, its developers, operators, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, digital assets, wallet balance depletion, revenue, data, or goodwill arising out of or in connection with:</p>

                    <li>Any failure, outage, technical error, security incident, exploit, compromise, or cessation of service by third-party wallet infrastructure providers (including Circle Internet Financial, LLC) or cloud providers.</li>

                <TSection title="18. User Assumption of Risk & Release">
                  <p>You acknowledge and agree that your decision to create an ArcFun Wallet, deposit cryptocurrency, bridge native assets, or execute trades is entirely voluntary. You assume full and exclusive responsibility for all risks associated with digital asset storage and third-party programmable wallet infrastructure. You hereby irrevocably release and waive any claims against ArcFun and its contributors arising from any third-party infrastructure failures, blockchain consensus forks, or external exploits.</p>
