      <LegalSection title="2. Description of ArcFun & Non-Custodial Role">
        <p>
          ArcFun provides a decentralized, non-custodial web software interface enabling users to interact directly with autonomous public smart contracts on supported blockchain networks. The core functionalities include:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20, display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: 8 }}>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>ArcFun Wallet:</strong> An embedded multi-chain digital wallet interface powered by Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets (Programmable Wallets), allowing users to generate and manage addresses across supported networks (e.g. Arc, Solana, Ethereum) through Circle&apos;s cryptographic infrastructure.</li>

          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Bridge Recovery Utility (/recover):</strong> Provides an interface allowing users to manually self-claim or resume pending cross-chain CCTP transfers using on-chain transaction data and Circle Iris attestations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ArcFun is not a bank, broker, dealer, exchange, custodian, investment adviser, money transmitter, or financial institution. ArcFun never takes custody of, controls, or holds beneficial title to any digital assets deployed by users.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="3. Eligibility">
        <p>You represent and warrant that:</p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20, display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: 8 }}>
          <li>You are at least 18 years of age or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction.</li>
          <li>You have full legal capacity and power to enter into these Terms.</li>
          <li>You are not located in, resident of, or organized under the laws of any jurisdiction subject to comprehensive economic sanctions (including sanctions enforced by OFAC, the UN, EU, or UK).</li>

      <LegalSection title="4. ArcFun Wallet Architecture & Circle Technology Disclosure">
        <p>
          ArcFun Wallet is powered by Circle Internet Financial, LLC (&quot;Circle&quot;) utilizing Circle&apos;s Programmable Wallets / Developer-Controlled Wallets (DCW) infrastructure and SDKs. You explicitly understand and agree that:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20, display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: 8 }}>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>No ArcFun Custody or Fund Access:</strong> ArcFun does NOT possess, hold, or store user private keys, seed phrases, or wallet funds. ArcFun operators, developers, and servers have zero custody and no direct access to withdraw, transfer, freeze, or confiscate your cryptocurrency balances.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Third-Party Cryptographic Key Infrastructure:</strong> Wallet address creation, cryptographic key management, hardware security module (HSM) signing, multi-party computation (MPC) sharding, and blockchain broadcasting are executed exclusively through Circle&apos;s independent API infrastructure and public blockchain nodes.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Mandatory Agreement for Funding:</strong> You must ONLY fund, deposit into, or bridge assets to an ArcFun Wallet if you fully understand and accept that ArcFun is not a custodian, does not guarantee wallet availability, and has no capacity to recover lost credentials or reverse on-chain transactions.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Self-Service Security Controls:</strong> Users configure security preferences (e.g. Passkeys, secondary authorization passwords, transaction limits) via our interface, which are transmitted to cryptographic verification endpoints. You are solely responsible for securing your personal device, browser session, and recovery credentials.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="5. Third-Party Infrastructure, Security Incidents & Partner Disclaimer">
        <p>
          ArcFun relies upon independent third-party technology providers, including Circle Internet Financial, LLC (for wallet infrastructure, CCTP, and Iris attestations), cloud hosting platforms, edge proxies (Cloudflare), and decentralized blockchain networks.
        </p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20, display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: 8 }}>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>No Control Over Third Parties:</strong> ArcFun does not own, operate, control, or supervise the internal servers, cryptographic enclaves, or operational security protocols of Circle or any other third-party provider.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Third-Party Exploits &amp; Technical Failures:</strong> In the event of any security breach, zero-day vulnerability, unauthorized access, server compromise, protocol exploit, network partition, technical disruption, insolvency, service cessation, or regulatory action affecting Circle, underlying blockchain networks, or third-party infrastructure partners, <strong style={{ color: "#ff5252" }}>ArcFun bears zero responsibility or liability</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>No Obligation to Reimburse:</strong> ArcFun is under no legal, financial, or equitable obligation to reimburse, refund, replace, or indemnify any user for losses, locked assets, delayed bridge completions, or diminished balances resulting from third-party infrastructure failures, network reorganizations, or external protocol exploits.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Circle Disclaimer:</strong> Circle is an independent third party and does not endorse, guarantee, or insure ArcFun or user balances held in ArcFun Wallets.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="6. ArcFun Bridge & Circle CCTP Integration">
        <p>When you use the ArcFun Bridge or Gateway:</p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20, display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: 8 }}>
          <li>You initiate and sign a source-chain transaction that deposits or burns native USDC through Circle CCTP or Gateway smart contracts.</li>
          <li>Circle Iris attestation services generate cryptographic proofs of burn once source-chain finality is achieved.</li>
          <li>Destination-chain completion may be submitted by ArcFun&apos;s relayer (where ArcFun only supplies destination gas fees) or executed directly by you via the /recover self-claim flow.</li>
          <li>Relayer gas credentials held by ArcFun are strictly operational gas-paying keys and do NOT have access to or control over user wallets.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="7. Web3 Chat & Social Payments">
        <p>
          ArcFun Web3 Chat enables direct wallet-to-wallet communication and integrated cryptocurrency transfers:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20, display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: 8 }}>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Peer-to-Peer Transfers:</strong> In-chat payments transfer funds directly between autonomous smart contracts and user-controlled addresses. ArcFun does not intermediate, hold in escrow, or take custody of in-chat payment funds.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Autopay &amp; Recurring Payments:</strong> Users may schedule automated transfers. Autopay transactions are authorized by the user and processed subject to pre-configured spending limits and account balances.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Recipient Verification:</strong> You are solely responsible for verifying the identity, public address, and recipient credentials of any party with whom you exchange messages or initiate transfers.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="8. Circle Gateway & Unified Liquidity">
        <p>
          Where supported, ArcFun facilitates unified liquidity settlement across multiple chains powered by Circle Gateway. Users understand that settlement speed, liquidity availability, and cross-chain messaging rely upon autonomous smart contracts and Circle infrastructure.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="10. Fees and Gas Costs">
        <p>
          Transactions on public blockchains require network gas fees paid directly to third-party validators. Where ArcFun charges a protocol fee on trades or deployments, such fees are clearly displayed in the interface and executed directly on-chain by the smart contracts. ArcFun does not promise or provide unverified future yield or revenue share mechanics.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="11. Transactions and Blockchain Finality">
        <p>
          Due to the immutable nature of blockchain networks, transactions cannot be cancelled, modified, or reversed once confirmed on-chain. ArcFun does not maintain a custodial refund pool. A reverted cross-chain or chat transfer does not create an ArcFun-held user balance. While the /recover tool allows claiming eligible pending bridge transfers when protocol state permits, recovery is not a guarantee of compensation for losses caused by external network failures.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="12. Prohibited Activities">
        <p>
          You agree not to use ArcFun for: illegal token issuance, fraud, rug pulls, scams, phishing, deploying malware or malicious contracts, sanctions evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing, market manipulation (such as wash trading or spoofing), abusive automated exploitation, or attempting to compromise platform infrastructure.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="13. No Investment Advice">
        <p>
          ArcFun does not provide financial, investment, legal, accounting, or tax advice. Market metrics, charts, prices, and token rankings shown on the interface are for informational purposes only. You are solely responsible for conducting your own research and evaluating the risks of any transaction.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="14. Disclaimer of Warranties">
        <p>
          ArcFun is provided on an &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; basis without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not guarantee uninterrupted, secure, or error-free access to the interface. Access may be modified or suspended at any time.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="15. Limitation of Liability">
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall ArcFun, its developers, operators, contributors, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, loss of digital assets, lost data, wallet balance depletion, or bridge delivery delays arising out of or in connection with:

          <li>Your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the Services, ArcFun Wallet, or ArcFun Bridge.</li>
          <li>Any failure, outage, technical error, security incident, exploit, compromise, or cessation of service by third-party wallet infrastructure providers (including Circle Internet Financial, LLC) or cloud providers.</li>
          <li>Smart contract bugs, algorithmic curve fluctuations, validator reorganizations, or unauthorized access to user devices or recovery credentials.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="16. User Assumption of Risk & Release">
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that your decision to create an ArcFun Wallet, deposit cryptocurrency, bridge native assets, or execute trades is entirely voluntary. You assume full and exclusive responsibility for all risks associated with digital asset storage and third-party programmable wallet infrastructure. You hereby irrevocably release and waive any claims against ArcFun and its contributors arising from any third-party infrastructure failures, blockchain consensus forks, or external exploits.

      <LegalSection title="3. Market Volatility & Total Loss of Capital">
        <p>

      <LegalSection title="4. Web3 Chat & Autopay Execution Risks">
        <p>
          Features that enable peer-to-peer messaging and automated recurring transfers carry specific operational considerations:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20, display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: 8 }}>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Irreversible Payments:</strong> In-chat transfers execute directly on public blockchains and cannot be recalled, stopped, or refunded by ArcFun once submitted.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Autopay Execution &amp; Gas:</strong> Scheduled autopay executions require sufficient token balances and network gas. If balances are depleted or network gas spikes exceed limits, scheduled executions will safely pause.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Social Engineering &amp; Impersonation:</strong> Malicious actors may attempt to solicit transfers via messaging. ArcFun will never message you requesting funds, seed phrases, or private keys.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="6. ArcFun Bridge & Circle CCTP Dependencies">
        <p>
          Cross-chain transfers via the ArcFun Bridge rely on Circle&apos;s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) and multi-chain network synchronization:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20, display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: 8 }}>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Block Finality &amp; Attestation Delays:</strong> Transfers require waiting for source-chain block confirmations before Circle Iris generates an attestation (typically 1–5 minutes, but longer during network congestion or reorganizations).</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Destination Execution:</strong> Relayer fulfillment depends on destination chain RPC availability and gas conditions. If relaying is delayed, users can complete transfers manually using the /recover self-claim flow.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Third-Party Dependency:</strong> ArcFun integrates with third-party infrastructure, including Circle&apos;s CCTP where applicable. Failures, delays, outages, protocol changes, or other issues affecting third-party infrastructure may affect ArcFun functionality. Circle does not guarantee transactions or insure user funds against losses.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="7. Smart Contract & Blockchain Vulnerabilities">
        <p>
          Smart contracts execute autonomously on public networks. Despite rigorous development standards, smart contracts may contain unforeseen software bugs, mathematical edge cases, validator reorganizations, network forks, or malicious exploits. Once a transaction is confirmed on-chain, it cannot be reversed by ArcFun.

          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Cookies:</strong> Small text snippets sent automatically with HTTP requests. ArcFun minimizes cookie usage strictly to essential bot defense and session security.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Local Storage (localStorage):</strong> Client-side key-value storage residing solely in your browser. This data is never automatically transmitted over the network and is used to remember your UI settings.</li>
