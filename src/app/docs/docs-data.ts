### What is ArcFun?

**ArcFun** (accessible via [thearcfun.xyz](https://thearcfun.xyz)) is an all-in-one decentralized Web3 finance platform and multi-chain execution environment. Built to solve multi-chain fragmentation, ArcFun combines high-speed cross-chain asset bridging and token swaps, a biometric-secured multi-chain native wallet, Circle Gateway unified liquidity, and real-time wallet-to-wallet messaging into a single, cohesive user experience.

With ArcFun, users no longer need to jump across dozens of disjointed decentralized apps, manage multiple browser wallet extensions, or worry about seed phrase vulnerabilities.

### Core Platform Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Circle CCTP Cross-Chain Bridge** | Fast native USDC cross-chain bridging across EVM networks and non-EVM ecosystems (Solana, Sui, Stellar) powered by Circle CCTP V2. |
| **ArcFun Native Wallet** | Hardware-secured multi-chain smart wallet provisioning institutional Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets (DCW) across both EVM (Arc & L2s) and Solana, unified under Touch ID / Face ID biometric passkeys. |
| **Web3 Chat & Social Pay** | Real-time wallet-to-wallet messaging with instant in-chat cryptocurrency transfers, recurring autopay, and direct contact tipping. |
| **Circle Gateway Unified Liquidity** | Institutional-grade unified balance and cross-chain settlement protocol supporting gas-sponsored transfers. |
| **Granular Security Policies** | Enterprise-grade safety engine with user-customizable 24-hour daily transfer caps, max per-transaction limits, and biometric threshold prompts. |
| **Consolidated Portfolio** | Multi-chain balance aggregator providing unified USD portfolio valuation, asset distribution breakdowns, and live oracle pricing. |

---

### Problems ArcFun Solves

1. **Multi-Chain Fragmentation:** Users traditionally juggle separate wallet extensions (e.g. MetaMask for EVM, Phantom for Solana) with separate seed phrases. ArcFun unifies EVM and SVM accounts under one seamless authentication session.
2. **Gas Dependency & Onboarding Hurdles:** Transferring funds on a new network normally requires acquiring that chain's native gas asset first. ArcFun utilizes paymaster gas sponsorship and native USDC gas abstraction.
3. **Catastrophic Wallet Draining:** Standard Web3 wallets allow total account drainage if a private key or session is compromised. ArcFun enforces strict 24-hour velocity limits and per-transaction caps before any transfer is signed.
4. **Complex Address Sharing:** Sending money to friends or contacts requires copying error-prone 44-character strings. ArcFun Web3 Chat allows direct contact-based messaging and one-tap in-chat payments.

### Platform Layers

ArcFun is engineered across four decoupled architectural layers to guarantee security, high throughput, and zero single points of failure:

1. **Client & Presentation Layer:**
   - React 19 & Next.js App Router application with responsive state handling.
   - Dual-mode deployment: full-screen Web3 DeFi dashboard and floating embeddable wallet manager widget.
   - Integrated Wagmi connectors (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, WalletConnect) and Solana Wallet Adapter, alongside WebAuthn biometric hardware modules.

2. **Policy Engine & Guardrail Layer:**
   - Pre-execution validation pipeline enforcing user-defined safety policies before any transaction can touch blockchain nodes.
   - Evaluates USD valuation against real-time oracle feeds (CoinGecko and DEX quotes).
   - Enforces rolling 24-hour volume caps and rejects transactions that exceed user thresholds.
   - Manages atomic intent locks (\`payment_ledger\`) with expiration timers to eliminate double-spend vectors.

3. **Multi-Chain Execution & Custody Layer:**
   - **Circle DCW Multi-Chain Engine:** Both EVM accounts (Arc Network & Ethereum/L2s) and Solana accounts are provisioned via Circle's institutional Developer-Controlled Wallet (DCW) APIs, with cryptographic key material safeguarded in institutional Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).
   - **Native Gas Sponsorship & RPC Routing:** Built-in paymasters sponsor gas for eligible cross-chain actions and provide high-availability RPC routing across supported chains.

4. **Data Synchronization & Realtime Messaging:**
   - Supabase PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.
   - Supabase Realtime websocket channels for instant chat delivery, typing indicators, and presence updates.
   - Background reconciliation continuously updating transaction states and on-chain blockchain hashes.

### How ArcFun Bridging Works

The **ArcFun Circle CCTP Bridge** module allows users to transfer native USDC seamlessly between blockchains without manual wrap/unwrap steps or risky liquidity pool bridges.

Users can bridge between:
- **Ethereum & Layer-2s:** Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Linea, Ink, Unichain, Polygon, Avalanche, Sonic
- **Non-EVM Blockchains:** Solana, Sui, Stellar
- **Testnets:** Arc Testnet, Sepolia networks, Monad Testnet, Sonic Testnet

---

### Circle CCTP Integration

For native USDC transfers, ArcFun leverages **Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**:
1. **Burn on Source:** Native USDC is burned directly on the source blockchain.
2. **Attestation:** Circle's attestation service cryptographically confirms the burn.
3. **Mint on Destination:** Native, un-wrapped USDC is minted directly on the recipient chain.

This eliminates the security vulnerabilities of traditional wrapped tokens and synthetic assets.

---

### Burn-and-Mint Security

ArcFun provides permissionless burn-and-mint settlement:
- **No Liquidity Pools or Slippage:** 1:1 cross-chain capital efficiency with zero slippage.
- **Self-Mint Recovery:** In the event of network congestion or relayer delays, users retain full control to manually complete the mint on the destination chain using ArcFun's built-in Recovery tool.
- **Unified Fee Estimation:** Displays estimated network execution fees upfront in transparent values.

### Dual-Engine Model

Most Web3 wallets force users to manage separate 12-word seed phrases, install conflicting browser extensions, and disconnect when switching between EVM and Solana. ArcFun eliminates these barriers through a **Unified Dual-Engine Architecture**:

- **EVM Account (Arc Network & L2s):** Provisioned on-demand via Circle's institutional Developer-Controlled Wallet (DCW) APIs directly on Arc Network and EVM chains.
- **Solana Account (SVM):** Simultaneously provisioned on-demand within the same unified wallet set via Circle's institutional Developer-Controlled Wallet (DCW) APIs.

Both accounts are created in a single step and secured by your device's biometric passkeys (Touch ID, Face ID, or Windows Hello). When you sign in, ArcFun automatically hydrates both addresses and displays your balances in a single consolidated portfolio—eliminating seed phrases, browser extensions, and manual network switching.

*(Note: Users who prefer using traditional external browser extensions like MetaMask or Phantom can still connect them separately through the external wallet connection option).*

---

### Biometrics & Passkeys (WebAuthn)

ArcFun replaces vulnerable 12-word paper seed phrases with **hardware-backed biometric passkeys**:
- **Touch ID, Face ID & Windows Hello:** Cryptographic key pairs generated inside your device's Secure Enclave / TPM chip via WebAuthn standards.
- **Phishing Resistant:** WebAuthn credentials cannot be harvested by fraudulent copycat websites.
- **Fallback Password Protection:** Users configure a secondary security password for devices without biometric hardware or browser compatibility.

---

### Consolidated Portfolio

Every asset in your ArcFun Wallet displays:
1. **Total Holdings:** Consolidated aggregate balance across all supported networks.
2. **Chain Breakdown:** Expanding an asset displays exact balances per blockchain with dedicated Send and Receive buttons.
3. **Real-Time Fiat Valuation:** Asset values refresh every 30 seconds using live market oracle feeds.

- Coordinates balance transfers across supported networks via institutional Circle APIs.
- Eliminates traditional 7-day optimistic rollup bridge withdrawal delays.
- Provides atomic execution guarantees backed by verifiable cryptographic attestations.

---

### Gasless Transfers & Sponsorship

On eligible transactions, ArcFun's **Fee Sponsorship Engine** sponsors destination execution fees:
- Users pay fees natively in stablecoins (USDC/EURC) rather than requiring native gas tokens (ETH/SOL).
- ArcFun's fee treasury automatically attests and relays the transaction to destination validators.

### Configurable Policy Parameters

ArcFun implements an active security policy engine (\`src/lib/security/policy-engine.ts\`) safeguarding every connected wallet:

| Policy Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Max Per Transaction** | \`$500.00 USD\` | Rejects any single transfer whose calculated USD valuation exceeds this limit. |
| **Daily Transfer Limit** | \`$1,000.00 USD\` | Rejects transfers if cumulative outgoing transfers within the last 24 hours exceed this cap. |
| **Passkey Threshold** | \`$100.00 USD\` | Transfers exceeding this value require Face ID / Touch ID biometric authentication. |
| **Velocity Cap** | Active | Prevents rapid consecutive transfers within seconds to stop automated drainer scripts. |

---

### Rolling 24-Hour Limits

Rather than resetting at midnight UTC, ArcFun calculates transfer volume across a true rolling 24-hour window:
\`\`\`typescript
// Rolling 24-hour daily limit enforcement
const oneDayAgo = Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
const { data: pastTxs } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('payment_ledger')
  .select('amount, token, status')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .gte('created_at', oneDayAgo)
  .in('status', ['RESERVED', 'SUBMITTING', 'PENDING', 'CONFIRMED', 'COMPLETE']);
\`\`\`

If a proposed transfer would push the 24-hour total above your configured daily cap, the transaction is safely rejected before any signatures are created.

---

### How to Increase Limits

If you need to make a larger transfer:
1. Open **ArcFun Wallet** and tap **Settings** (or click the alert banner in the transfer screen).
2. Navigate to **Security Center**.
3. Adjust your **Per-Transaction Limit** or **Daily Transfer Cap**.
4. Confirm the modification with your biometric passkey or master password.

### Wallet Connection Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble connecting or verifying your wallet in the ArcFun Native Wallet modal, follow these diagnostic steps:

1. **Verify Browser Extension State:**
   - Make sure your wallet extension (MetaMask, Phantom, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet) is unlocked and on the latest version.
   - If multiple wallet extensions conflict (e.g. Phantom and MetaMask intercepting \`window.ethereum\`), try temporarily disabling unused extensions or opening the app in an Incognito window.
2. **Network & Chain Selection:**
   - ArcFun connects to supported EVM chains (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Ethereum, Polygon) and Solana.
   - If prompted by your wallet to switch chains, accept the network switch request.
3. **Biometric & Passkey Prompt:**
   - ArcFun Native Smart Wallets utilize hardware-backed WebAuthn (Touch ID / Face ID / Windows Hello) for transaction authorization.
   - Ensure your browser permits WebAuthn credentials and biometric prompts.
4. **RPC & Firewall Diagnostics:**
   - If connection timeouts occur, check whether aggressive ad-blockers, VPN firewalls, or privacy extensions are blocking WebSocket or RPC calls to \`thearcfun.xyz\` and Circle APIs.
